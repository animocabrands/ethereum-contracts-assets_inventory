 * @title ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard, optional Inventory extension
 * @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-xxxx
 * Interface for fungible/non-fungible tokens management on a 1155-compliant contract.
 *
 * This interface rationalizes the co-existence of fungible and non-fungible tokens
 * within the same contract. As several kinds of fungible tokens can be managed under
 * the Multi-Token standard, we consider that non-fungible tokens can be classified
 * under their own specific type. We introduce the concept of non-fungible collection
 * and consider the usage of 3 types of identifiers:
 * (a) Fungible Token identifiers, each representing a set of Fungible Tokens,
 * (b) Non-Fungible Collection identifiers, each representing a set of Non-Fungible Tokens (this is not a token),
 * (c) Non-Fungible Token identifiers. 

 * Identifiers nature
 * |       Type                | isFungible  | isCollection | isToken |
 * |  Fungible Token           |   true      |     true     |  true   |
 * |  Non-Fungible Collection  |   false     |     true     |  false  |
 * |  Non-Fungible Token       |   false     |     false    |  true   |
 *
 * Identifiers compatibilities
 * |       Type                |  transfer  |   balance    |   supply    |  owner  |
 * |  Fungible Token           |    OK      |     OK       |     OK      |   NOK   |
 * |  Non-Fungible Collection  |    NOK     |     OK       |     OK      |   NOK   |
 * |  Non-Fungible Token       |    OK      |   0 or 1     |   0 or 1    |   OK    |
 *
 * Note: The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x469bd23f.
